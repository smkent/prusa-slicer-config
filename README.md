# Sovol SV06 Plus profile

PrusaSlicer includes a built-in Sovol SV06 Plus printer profile.

My Sovol SV06 Plus printer profile is based on the built-in profile with custom
start and end G-code, plus a different bed mesh and texture.

## G-code customizations

Start G-code:

* Heat the bed to 5Â°C below the target bed temperature before heating the
  nozzle.
* Draw the purge line just outside the print area along the X-axis (the built-in
  profile draws the purge line within the print area along the Y-axis), like the
  Prusa MK3S+ built-in profile. I randomized the purge line position
  along the X-axis to prevent wear on a single spot.

End G-code:

* Raise the Z-axis higher than the default profile does, along with a small
  filament retraction.
* Stop heating the nozzle and bed before turning off the fan.
